Windowed ChatGPT is an app that enhances the ChatGPT experience by wrapping it in a tab-able window. In addition to the base functionality of ChatGPT, this app adds several key features including multiple tabs, multiple windows, and a global shortcut for quick access. The app also has auto-focus functionality on the prompt textbox to make input easier and allow for better compatibility with Alfred workflows (coming soon).

This app was inspired by the work of @vincelwt's chatgpt-mac, which formed the foundation of this app. All credit and copyrights go to OpenAI and @vincelwt.
