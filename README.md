# Windowed ChatGPT with auto focus

This app wraps ChatGPT in a tab-able window. The primary functionality this app adds is auto-focus on the prompt textbox (on window refocus or tab change) to allow for easier input and better compatability with Alfred workflows (coming soon).

Inspired by @vincelwt's [chatgpt-mac](https://github.com/vincelwt/chatgpt-mac), which formed the foundation of this app.
